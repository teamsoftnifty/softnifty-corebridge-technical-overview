# 🔁 Process Flows

This folder contains the public-safe process flow diagrams that describe how CoreBridge operates end-to-end.

## Included flows
1. **Design-Time Mapping & Configuration**
   - how mapping configurations are generated, validated, and published

2. **Runtime Transaction Processing**
   - high-level lifecycle of transaction processing and status handling

3. **ESG / ECO Reporting**
   - how telemetry is captured, stored, aggregated, and reported

## Files
- `01_Design_Mapping_Configuration_Process_v01.pdf`
- `02_Runtime_Transaction_Process_v01.pdf`
- `03_ESG_Reporting_Process_v01.pdf`

## Publishing rules
These diagrams must remain:
- high-level and implementation-agnostic
- free from sensitive thresholds, bank samples, or network routing secrets
- consistent with the conceptual architecture in `/architecture/`
