## 🚨 How to report a vulnerability

### 1) Email us privately
Please send details to:

- **security@softnifty.com** *(preferred)*
- If unavailable: **teamsoftnifty@gmail.com** *(fallback)*

### 2) Include the essentials
To help us triage quickly, include:

- a clear description of the issue and potential impact  
- steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if safe)  
- affected file(s) / page(s) / component(s)  
- your environment details (browser, OS, versions)  
- screenshots or logs *(redacted)*  

---

## ⏱️ Response expectations
We aim to:
- acknowledge your report within **3–5 business days**
- provide a triage outcome and next steps as soon as practical
- coordinate responsible disclosure timing when relevant

---

## ✅ Safe harbour (good-faith research)
We will not pursue legal action for good-faith security research that:
- avoids privacy violations and data destruction  
- avoids service disruption (DoS)  
- does not access or exfiltrate data  
- does not use social engineering, phishing, or physical access  
- is reported promptly and privately

---

## 🔒 Please do not
- open a public GitHub issue for a vulnerability  
- publish exploit details before a fix is available  
- test against customer/third-party payment systems  
- attempt credential stuffing, brute force, or scanning beyond what is necessary  

---

## 📌 Notes
This repository is **documentation-only** and intentionally excludes runtime source code and sensitive configurations.  
For controlled-access technical evidence and deeper artefacts, Softnifty maintains private repositories available upon request.
