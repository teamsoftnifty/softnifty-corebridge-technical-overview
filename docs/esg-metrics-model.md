# ESG/ECO Metrics Model (Public)

This page describes the public-safe ESG/ECO reporting model.

## What we measure (examples)
- transaction counts by period/channel
- abstracted processing indicators
- aggregation into operational efficiency metrics
- dashboard-ready metrics for trend visibility

## Notes
Specific calculation formulas, weightings, and internal optimisation strategies are retained in a controlled-access private repository.
