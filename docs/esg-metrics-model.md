# ESG/ECO Metrics Model (Public)

This page describes the public-safe ESG/ECO reporting model.

## What we measure (examples)
- transaction counts by period/channel
- abstracted processing indicators
- aggregation into operational efficiency metrics
- dashboard-ready metrics for trend visibility

## Example outputs (public-safe)
- volume trends (daily/weekly/monthly)
- channel-level views (e.g., card, transfer, mobile)
- operational efficiency indicators (abstracted)
- ESG/ECO reporting summaries for stakeholders

## Notes
Specific calculation formulas, weightings, and internal optimisation strategies are retained in a controlled-access private repository.
