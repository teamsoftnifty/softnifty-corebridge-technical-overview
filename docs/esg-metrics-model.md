# ESG/ECO Metrics Model (Public)

This document describes the public-safe ESG/ECO reporting model.

## What we measure (examples)
- transaction counts by channel/period
- compute/processing indicators (abstracted)
- aggregation into operational efficiency metrics
- ESG dashboards for trend visibility

## Notes
Specific calculation formulas, weightings, and internal optimisation strategies are retained in the private evidence repository.
