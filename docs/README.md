# 📚 Documentation

This folder contains supporting documentation for the **public, docs-only** CoreBridge overview.

## Recommended documents (public-safe)
- `product-overview.md` — what CoreBridge is and who it serves
- `architecture.md` — written explanation of the architecture diagram
- `security-model.md` — high-level security approach (no sensitive details)
- `esg-metrics-model.md` — what we measure and why
- `api-contracts.md` — abstract API shapes (no real endpoints)
- `glossary.md` — terms, acronyms, and definitions

## Guidance
Keep documents:
- explanatory rather than implementation-revealing
- consistent with published diagrams
- free from customer data, secrets, or internal infrastructure details
