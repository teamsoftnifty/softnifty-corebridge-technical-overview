# 🧾 Release Notes (Public Docs)

This page tracks **public documentation changes** and **public artefact versions** (diagrams, screenshots, portal pages).

> This is not a runtime software changelog — the runtime engine remains private.

## How to update
When you change any public artefact:
- add a dated entry
- note what changed and why it matters
- keep it factual and short
